# üîê Network Vulnerability Report

## üîç Port 21 -  

üìú **CVEs**: CVE-1999-0095, CVE-1999-0082, CVE-1999-1471, CVE-1999-1122, CVE-1999-1467

üìù **AI Analysis**:
Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the network service for vulnerabilities and provide remediations.

**Service:** FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

**CVEs:**

1. **CVE-1999-0095**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in ftpd allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the ftp daemon. Severity: HIGH
	* Description: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ftpd service, which allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.
2. **CVE-1999-0082**: FTP server returns incorrect directory listings, possibly leading to unauthorized access. Severity: MEDIUM
	* Description: The FTP server returns incorrect directory listings, allowing an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
3. **CVE-1999-1471**: FTP server does not properly handle long file names, allowing remote attackers to overwrite files or create new files. Severity: HIGH
	* Description: The FTP server fails to handle long file names correctly, allowing an attacker to overwrite files or create new files with arbitrary content.
4. **CVE-1999-1122**: FTP server does not properly validate user input, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Severity: MEDIUM
	* Description: The FTP server does not validate user input correctly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition when receiving malicious requests.
5. **CVE-1999-1467**: FTP server allows remote attackers to read or write files outside the intended directory. Severity: HIGH
	* Description: The FTP server allows an attacker to read or write files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data corruption.

**Remediation Steps (Linux):**

To remediate these vulnerabilities on a Linux system:

1. Update the ftpd service:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```
2. Upgrade the FTP server to a patched version:
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
3. Set the `FTPANONMOUNTEXPIRED` environment variable to prevent anonymous users from accessing files outside their intended directory:
```bash
export FTPANONMOUNTEXPIRED=1
```
4. Restrict access to the FTP server by configuring firewall rules or SELinux policies to only allow trusted connections.
5. Consider upgrading to a more secure FTP alternative, such as sftp (Secure File Transfer Protocol) or ftps (FTP over SSL/TLS).

**Risk Level:**

Based on the severity of the vulnerabilities and potential impact, I rate the risk level as:

* **CVE-1999-0095**: CRITICAL
* **CVE-1999-0082**, **CVE-1999-1471**, **CVE-1999-1122**, **CVE-1999-1467**: HIGH

These vulnerabilities are relatively old, but they still pose a significant risk if not addressed. It's essential to prioritize their remediation to ensure the security of your system and data.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider disabling the FTP service or limiting its access to only trusted networks.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for FTP users.
* Regularly update and patch your Linux distribution to ensure you have the latest security fixes.
